## Open from Azure Websites

__Open any web application hosted on Azure Websites directly in Visual Studio.__

All you need is your Azure Webistes publish settings file. You can get the file in two ways:

1. Download it from the Dashboard for the website on the Azure Portal online.
2. Use Server Explorer to find the Azure | Websites node and right-click to download.

A new button appears in the `File` top menu as shown below.
